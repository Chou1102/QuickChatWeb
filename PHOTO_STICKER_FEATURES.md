## File Structure

```
uploads/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/          # Uploaded photos
â””â”€â”€ stickers/        # Uploaded stickers

client/src/components/
â”œâ”€â”€ SingleChat.js    # Main chat component with upload functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ ScrollableChat.js # Message display component
â””â”€â”€ StickerPicker.js # Sticker selection component
```

## Dependencies Added

### Backend
- `multer` - File upload handling
- `multer-storage-cloudinary` - Cloud storage (optional, currently using local storage)

### Frontend
- `react-file-base64` - File upload component (already present)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloud Storage**: Integrate with Cloudinary or AWS S3 for production

1. Start the backend server: `npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `cd client && npm start`
3. Login to the application
4. Start a chat conversation
5. Use the attachment button to send photos and stickers
